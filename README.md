# Kubernetes Dashboard desktop app (unofficial)
It's an attempt to pack official [kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) in a single desktop app using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

The project is still in the PoC stage as I'm looking for the best way to add needed modifications to the base app without changing its source code.

## Build & Run
```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
